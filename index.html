				<h3>Computer Programs</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Computer programs are everywhere. They:
					<ul>
						<li>Run parts of your car.</li>
					    <li>Let you check your email.</li>
					    <li>Underlie that favorite app on your smartphone.</li>
					</ul>
					<li> But what are they, really?</li>
				<ul/>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>What is a Computer Program?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>At its core, a program is a list of instructions that tell the computer exactly what to do.</li>
					<li>Of course, computers don’t understand natural language, so those instructions have to be written in a way that the computer can understand. That’s where programming languages come in.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Programming Languages</h3>
				<p>You can think of programming languages just like you would of a foreign language such as French, German, Japanese, or Arabic.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>People from different countries might tell the same story, but the language and syntax would be different depending on where they are from.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<p>Similarly, you can write a program that does the same thing in different programming language. The language you use for a program depends on a number of things:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How the program will be used.</li>
					<li>What you want the program to do.</li>
					<li>What languages you know.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Programming Languages</h3>
				<p>For example:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>To develop websites, you might use HTML, JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP.</li>
					<li>To create databases and move information in and out of them, you might use MySQL, SQL, Dbase.</li>
					<li>To write applications like Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat, you might use C++, Java, Visual Basic</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Aside #1</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>A big secret:</b> Computers don’t exactly understand programming languages (such as Java or Python) either. They need interpreters to convert the instructions into something that they can understand.</li>
					<li>Those interpreters eventually breaking the instructions down into strings of 1’s and 0’s-- binary numbers that most people can’t read easily-- to be able to do anything with them.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>For example, the letter 'A' in a computer has the binary representation: 01000001.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Despite being able to decipher those unintelligible strings of 1’s and 0’s, computers are actually pretty dumb. </li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Computers are dumb</h3>
				<p>Computers can only do what they have instructions for-- and they take those instructions VERY literally.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>As a result, you have to tell them every single thing you want them to do and every single thing to take into consideration. </li>
				</ul>
				<br><br>
				<p>If you leave any instructions out (or put them in the “wrong” order), the results might not be what you expect.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Activity #1</h3>
				<p>Divide M&M's into piles by color.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Discussion</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>How difficult was that task?</li>
					<li>Did we give enough instructions?</li>
					<li>How hard was it to adjust when we gave new instructions in the middle?</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h3>Activity #2</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Let’s try that activity again in pairs:This time, one person will give instructions and the other will pretend to be the “computer.”</li>
					<li>The “computer” can only do what the person tells it to do-- remember to take the instructions literally!</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Discussion</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>How did that go?</li>
					<li>What made it more difficult?</li>
					<li>Did you find ways to make it easier?</li>
					<li>How many different ways did pairs use to accomplish the goal?</li>
				<ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Programming structures</h3>
				<p>[We're still coming up with a good way to transition here, so we can move from activity to a discussion of the fact that no matter what programming language you use, the structures that are available are pretty much the same. ]</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Variables</h3>
				<p>A computer doesn’t have a memory like we do. Sure, a computer has “memory”-- In fact it has a couple of kinds...</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Aside #2: Kinds of memory</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>ROM</b> or <b>Read-only memory</b> is the more permanent kind.
					<br>When you use <b>File > Save</b>, you’re storing a file in ROM.</li>
					<li><b>RAM</b> or <b>Random-access memory</b> is less permanent. It’s the memory that the computer uses to do its work. 
					<br>
					Information stored in RAM is only there for a short time-- sometimes just for as long as it takes to finish a task. When the task is complete, the information disappears. When you close the program or turn off the computer, the data in RAM disappears.</li>
					<li>To remember and use <b>anything</b> in RAM, the computer has to have a way to identify and store it. That’s where variables come in.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Variables</h3>
				<p>A variable is essentially a storage container for information.</p>
				<p>There are different kinds of variables based on the information that you want to store.</p>
				<p>In our M&M example, you might need to store information like:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How many M&Ms were in my cup?</li>
					<li>How many colors are there?</li>
					<li>What are the different colors?</li>
					<li>How many green M&Ms did I have?</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Declaring Variables</h3>
				<p>When you want to use a variable, you generally have to <b>declare</b> the variable. Declaring a variable means telling  the computer a few things:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>That you’re going to use a variable.</li>
					<li>What you’re going to call it.</li>
					<li>What kind of information it’s going to hold.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Integer Variables</h3>
				<p>Integer variables are used to store positive or negative whole numbers.</p>
				<br>
				<p>If you want to store the number of M&Ms that were in the cup to begin with, you would use an integer variable and then give it a value:</p>
				<br>
				<p>var total_pieces = Integer</p>
				<p>total_pieces = 12</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>String Variables</h3>
				<p>String variables are used to store strings of text.</p>
				<p>If you wanted to tell the computer the colors of the M&Ms, you would use string variables:</p>
				<pre><code="html">
					var color_1 = String
					var color_2 = String
					var color_3 = String
					color_1 = red
					color_2 = green
					color_3 = yellow
				</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Aside #3: Numbers as strings</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>You <b>can</b> store a number as a string.</li> 
					<li>If you store a number as a string, you can’t use it in any calculations.</li>
					<li>With that restriction, some numbers can easily be treated as strings:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>House addresses</li>
						<li>Zip code</li>
						<li>Order codes on a website</li>
						<li>Your credit card number</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Boolean Variables</h3>
				<p>Boolean variables are used to store the value <b>TRUE</b> or <b>FALSE</b> (yes or no). You define a condition, then use a Boolean to tell the computer whether that condition is true or false.</p>
				<p>
				<p>In our M&M example, you had to keep sorting until there were no more M&Ms left in your cup. In that case, the condition could be defined as “There are M&Ms left in the cup.”</p>
				<ul>
					<li>At the beginning of the activity, the condition was <b>true</b>.</li>
					<li>For most of the activity, the condition stayed <b>true</b>.</li>
					<li>As soon as you took the last M&M out of the cup, the condition changed to <b>false</b>.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The Boolean would look like this:</p>
				<pre><code="html">
					M&Ms_In_Cup = Boolean
					M&M_In_Cup = True
				</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>[Need a title here]</h3>
				<p>Now that you can store data, you probably want to do something with it.</p> 
				<p>[Working on a transition here... to explain what they are used for and why we think learning these things will really help in the other GDIBoulder classes like Python and JavaScript.]</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>If/Then/Else</h3>
				<p>If/Then/Else statements evaluate a condition and take actions based on the result:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If the condition is true, the computer does the action or actions that are listed in the <b>Then</b> statement.</li>
					<li>If the condition is false, the computer does the action or actions that are listed in the <b>Else</b> statement.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Pseudo code example</h3>
				<p>If there are M&Ms left in your cup, take one out and sort it. If there aren’t any more left, let me know.</p>
				<pre><code="html">
					var pieces_in_cup = Integer
					pieces_in_cup = 12

					IF total_pieces is not equal to 0 
					THEN 
							PRINT ‘’Take an M&M out of the cup.’’
						[Put it in the correct pile.]
						[Reduce the value of pieces_in_cup by 1.]
					ELSE
							PRINT ‘’There are no more M&M’s in the cup!’’
				</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Loops</h3>
				<p>A loop is a list of instructions that keeps repeating until it reaches a certain condition.</p>
				<p>Example: Think of a loop like a question you would ask that you want a particular answer to.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Ask the question.</li>
					<li>Someone answers the question.</li>
					<li>Is it the answer you wanted?</li>
					<li>If no, ask the question again. You may need to keep asking the same original question over and over again until you get the answer you wanted.</li>
					<li>If the answer you wanted is answered (yes), you are done asking your question. You’ve exited the loop.</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Partner Excercise</h3>
				<p>One person does the sorting based on instructions given by their partner.</p>
				<p>We can say more about this</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>M&M Project</h3>
				<p>If we took the basics of what we just learned for the M&M project, the following are examples of some of the things that could be used:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Languages to use to tell the computer what to do:
					<ul> 
						<li>Python: detailed steps</li>
						<li>SQL: manage the M&M data</li>
						<li>HTML/CSS: web development to share on the internet</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Computer program:</li> 
					<ul>
						<li>Variables: place to store the M&M information such as, colors, amounts, etc.</li>
						<li>Detailed steps to tell the computer what to do.</li>
						<li>Loops: Instructions that keeps repeating until all of the M&M’s have been counted (we change this).</li>
					</ul>
				</ol>
