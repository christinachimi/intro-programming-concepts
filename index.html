				<h3>Computer Programs</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Computer programs are everywhere. They:
					<ul>
						<li>Run parts of your car.</li>
					    <li>Let you check your email.</li>
					    <li>Underlie that favorite app on your smartphone.</li>
					</ul>
					<li> But what are they, really?</li>
				<ul/>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>What is a Computer Program?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>At its core, a program is a list of instructions that tell the computer exactly what to do.</li>
					<li>Of course, computers don’t understand natural language, so those instructions have to be written in a way that the computer can understand. That’s where programming languages come in.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Programming Languages</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>You can think of programming languages just like you would of a foreign language such as French, German, Japanese, or Arabic.</li>
					<li>People from different countries might tell the same story, but the language and syntax would be different depending on where they are from.</li>
					<li>Similarly, you can write a program that does the same thing in different programming language. The language you use for a program depends on a number of things:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>How the program will be used.</li>
						<li>What you want the program to do.</li>
						<li>What languages you know.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Programming Languages</h3>
				<!--<p>For example:</p>-->
				<ul>
					<li>To develop websites, you might use HTML, JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP.</li>
					<li>To create databases and move information in and out of them, you might use MySQL, SQL, Dbase.</li>
					<li>To write applications like Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat, you might use C++, Java, Visual Basic</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Aside #1</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>A big secret:</b> Computers don’t exactly understand programming languages (such as Java or Python) either. They need interpreters to convert the instructions into something that they can understand.</li>
					<li>Those interpreters eventually break the instructions down into strings of 1’s and 0’s-- binary numbers that most people can’t read easily-- to be able to do anything with them.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>For example, the letter 'A' in a computer has the binary representation: 01000001.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Despite being able to decipher those unintelligible strings of 1’s and 0’s, computers are actually pretty dumb. </li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Computers are dumb</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Computers can only do what they have instructions for-- and they take those instructions VERY literally.</li>
					<li>As a result, you have to tell them every single thing you want them to do and every single thing to take into consideration. </li>
					<li>If you leave any instructions out (or put them in the “wrong” order), the results might not be what you expect.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Activity #1</h3>
				<p>Divide M&M's into piles by color.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Discussion</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>How difficult was that task?</li>
					<li>Did we give enough instructions?</li>
					<li>How hard was it to adjust when we gave new instructions in the middle?</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Activity #2</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Let’s try that activity again in pairs: This time, one person will give instructions and the other will pretend to be the “computer.”</li>
					<li>The “computer” can only do what the person tells it to do-- remember to take the instructions literally!</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Discussion</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>How did that go?</li>
					<li>What made it more difficult?</li>
					<li>Did you find ways to make it easier?</li>
					<li>How many different ways did pairs use to accomplish the goal?</li>
				<ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Programming structures</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>No matter what programming language you use, the structures that are available are pretty much the same.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Variables</li>
						<li>Logical structures:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If/Then/Else statements</li>
							<li>Loops</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Variables</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>A computer doesn’t have a memory like we do. Sure, a computer has “memory”-- In fact it has a couple of kinds...</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Aside #2: Kinds of memory</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>ROM</b> or <b>Read-only memory</b> is the more permanent kind.</li>
					<li>When you use <b>File > Save</b>, you’re storing a file in ROM.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Aside #2: Kinds of memory</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>RAM</b> or <b>Random-access memory</b> is less permanent.</li>
					<li>It’s the memory that the computer uses to do its work.</li>
					<li>Information stored in RAM is only there for a short time-- sometimes just for as long as it takes to finish a task. When the task is complete, the information disappears. When you close the program or turn off the computer, the data in RAM disappears.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Memory example</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Using Cut & Paste in a Word document:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>When you <b>cut</b>, the text is saved in <b>RAM</b>.</li>
						<li>When you <b>paste</b>, the text is retrieved from <b>RAM</b> and put back into the document.</li>
						<li>When you save the document, it moves to <b>ROM</b>.</li>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Back to Variables</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>To remember and use <b>anything</b> in RAM, the computer has to have a way to identify and store it. That’s where <b>variables</b> come in.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Variables</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>A variable is essentially a storage container for information.</li>
					<li>There are different kinds of variables based on the information that you want to store.</li>
					<li>In our M&M example, you might need to store information like:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>How many M&Ms were in my cup?</li>
						<li>How many colors are there?</li>
						<li>What are the different colors?</li>
						<li>How many green M&Ms did I have?</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Declaring Variables</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>When you want to use a variable, you generally have to <b>declare</b> the variable.</li>
					<li>Declaring a variable means telling  the computer a few things about the storage container that you want to create:</li>
				</ul>
					<ul>
						<li>That you’re going to use a variable.</li>
						<li>What you’re going to call it.</li>
						<li>What kind of information it’s going to hold.</li>
					</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Integer Variables</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Integer variables are used to store positive or negative whole numbers.</li>
					<li>If you want to store the number of M&Ms that were in the cup to begin with, you would use an integer variable and then give it a value:</li>
				<pre><code="html">
var total_pieces = Integer
total_pieces = 12
				</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>String Variables</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>String variables are used to store text.</li>
					<li>If you wanted to tell the computer the colors of the M&Ms, you would use string variables:</li>
				<pre><code="html">
var color_1 = String
var color_2 = String
var color_3 = String
color_1 = red
color_2 = green
color_3 = yellow
				</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Aside #3: Numbers as strings</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>You <b>can</b> store a number as a string variable.</li><li>If you store a number as a string variable, you can’t use it in any math calculations.</li>
					<li>For example, zip codes are all numbers, but you would never use them in math calculations.</li>
					<li>With that restriction, some other numbers that can easily be treated as strings:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>House addresses</li>
						<li>Order codes on a website</li>
						<li>Your credit card number</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Boolean Variables</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Boolean variables are used to store the value <b>TRUE</b> or <b>FALSE</b> (yes or no).</li>
					<li>You define a condition, then use a Boolean to tell the computer whether that condition is true or false.</li>
					<li>The Boolean would look like this:</li>
				</ul>
				<pre><code="html">
M&Ms_In_Cup = Boolean
M&M_In_Cup = True
				</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Logical structures</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Now that you can store data, you probably want to do something with it.</li>
					<li>Logical structures provide the framework for using that data to "get stuff done".</li>
					<li>These structures are consistent across programming languages-- so if you understand the concepts, you can learn how to represent them in any programming language.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>If/Then/Else</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>If/Then/Else statements evaluate a condition and take actions based on the result:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>If the condition is true, the computer does the action or actions that are listed in the <b>Then</b> statement.</li>
							<li>If the condition is false, the computer does the action or actions that are listed in the <b>Else</b> statement.</li>
							<li>Note: Else statements are not required.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Example:
						<ul>
							<li>If the temperature is below 45 degrees, then I will wear a jacket; else, I will not wear a jacket.</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Pseudocode example</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>If there are M&Ms left in your cup, take one out and sort it. If there aren’t any more left, report that there aren't any left.</li>
				<pre><code="html">
Pseudocode:<br>
var pieces_in_cup = Integer
pieces_in_cup = 12

IF total_pieces is not equal to 0
  THEN
	    PRINT ‘’Take an M&M out of the cup.’’
	    [Put it in the correct pile.]
	    [Reduce the value of pieces_in_cup by 1.]
  ELSE
	    PRINT ‘’There are no more M&M’s in the cup!’’
				</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Loops</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>A loop is a list of instructions that repeats until a certain condition is reached.</li>
					<li>Two kinds of loops are <b>For Loops</b> and <b>While Loops</b>.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>For Loops</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>For loops generally let you repeat an action a specific number of times-- and that number is known before you start.</li>
					<li>For example: A newspaper delivery person has a route of 65 houses.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>They are not going to deliver 72 or 87 or 46 papers-- they're going to deliver 65.</li>
						<li>If someone puts on a vacation hold, they're going to know that at the beginning, so they're only going to deliver 64. But they knew that to begin with.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
			<h3>For Loop Pseudocode</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>We could represent our M&M example as a <b>For loop</b> if the first thing you did was count the number of M&Ms that were in your cup.</li>
				<li>That would tell you how many M&Ms you have to sort.</li>
				<li>Let's say the count was 15 total.</li>
			<pre><code="html">
Pseudocode:<br>
For each of my 15 M&Ms, do this procedure:
	[Take it out of the cup]
	[Determine what color it is]
	[Put it in the correct pile]

End
			</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>While Loops</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>While loops let you do an action or set of actions until a particular condition changes.</li>
					<li>When you start the loop, you indicate what the condition is and what should happen for as long as the condition is true.</li>
					<li>Examples:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>While my favorite show is on TV, I’ll sit and watch it.
							(When your favorite show ends, you’ll get up and do something else.)</li>
							<li>While it is before midnight, I’ll read my book.
							(When midnight arrives, you’ll close the book and go to sleep.)</li>
							<li>While the cat is asleep on my lap, I’ll be stuck on the couch.</li>
						</ul>
				<ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>While Loops</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>You can use a While loop in our M&M example if you establish a condition related to the number of M&Ms in the cup:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>While there are M&Ms in the cup, I’ll keep taking them out and sorting them into piles.
							(The implication is that, as soon as the cup is empty, you’ll stop sorting.)</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>While Loops Pseudocode</h3>
				<pre><code="html">
var candy_in_cup = Boolean
candy_in_cup = TRUE

While candy_in_cup = TRUE
    [Take one M&M out of cup]
    [Determine what color it is]
    [Put it in the correct pile]
    [Check to see if there’s any more candy in the cup]

	    IF [there’s no more candy in the cup]
	        THEN candy_in_cup = FALSE
	END
     			</code></pre>
     		</section>

			<section>
				<h3>M&M Project</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>If you were really going to implement an M&M sorting program, you might use these:</li>
				</ul>
				<ol>
					<li>Possible languages to use:
					<ul>
						<li>Python: computer program</li>
						<li>SQL: manage the M&M data</li>
						<li>HTML/CSS: web development to share on the Internet</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Programming structures:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Variables: place to store the M&M information such as, colors, amounts, etc.</li>
						<li>Detailed steps to tell the computer what to do.</li>
						<li>Loops: Instructions that keeps repeating until all of the M&M’s have been counted.</li>
					</ul>
				</ol>
